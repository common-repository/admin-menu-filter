Admin Menu Filter it's a plugin that put a textbox in the admin interfase and allow filter top menu items and child items. Useful with extensive admin menu interfases .

== Description ==

Sometimes you may have a lot of admin menu items based on your Wordpress installation, with this plugin you only need to type a few letters of the item name that you look and voila! Using a custom jQuery expression that turns 'contains' to case insensitive, the plugin adds a class 'filtered' for non-match elements and performs actions based on 2 simple rules:

1. For parent menu item matching the item keeps visible. 
2. For child menu item matching the item keeps highlighted and their parent visible, keeping the rule #1 for the rest of parent menu items.
